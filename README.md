## Features
- Can clean a bit of clutter from the novel layout including the faded border around the edges.
- Allows increasing the height of the way too short input and memory boxes in novels.
- Can override a variety of settings for the chatbox in novels. Among other benefits this fixes the problem of the site not remembering your sizing and placement for the chatbox.
- It can expand novels to take up the full page instead of the tiny portion they default into.
- A configuration menu where all of these options can be adjusted to your liking.

## Installing
You'll need a userstyle manager that supports the stylus preprocessor such as the Stylus browser extension.
